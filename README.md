**Project Overview**

Urban traffic congestion is a growing challenge, leading to increased travel times, fuel consumption, and emissions. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize traffic signal timings dynamically based on real-time traffic conditions.

**Key Features**
Real-Time Traffic Monitoring
Collects live traffic data from cameras and sensors at intersections.
Traffic Prediction Using AI
Implements LSTMs/Transformers to forecast traffic flow.
Reinforcement Learning-Based Signal Control
Dynamic Signal Adjustments
Green signal timings adapt based on incoming and outgoing vehicle counts.
Simulation & Testing
Trained in a simulated environment before real-world deployment.

**Technologies Used**
Programming Languages: Python, C++
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Optimization Algorithms: Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms
Data Handling: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV (for traffic analysis)
Database: Neo4j

**How It Works?**
Traffic Data Collection → Sensors & cameras collect vehicle movement data.
Traffic Pattern Analysis → AI models predict congestion patterns.
RL-Based Decision Making → The model selects optimal green light durations.
Dynamic Adjustments → Traffic lights adapt based on real-time data.

**Future Enhancements**
Integration with Edge AI for faster decision-making.
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication for better coordination.
Expansion to multi-intersection networks for broader coverage."# traffic-management-system"
